### Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple Blog web app using Node JS - Express - Mongo DB.

### Description
* The blog posts are stored in database and fetched from there whenever is needed. The things that I've applied in this project are:. 

* For the frond-end part:
  * I've used Bootstrap 5 for most of the design.
  * Whenever Bootstrap is insufficient I've applied basic HTML and CSS.
  * I've made a responsive design for all viewports..

* For the back-end part:
 * I've used Node JS and Express framework for the server side.
 * To render JS codes for the dynamic data in the client-side, I've used EJS (Embedded Javascript)
 * To store the blog posts, I've used Mongo DB Atlas.
 * To make CRUD operations on database, I've used Mongoose module of NPM
 * I've applied pagination for displaying post-cards
 * I've applied my own Restful API.
